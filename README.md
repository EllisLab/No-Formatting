# No-Formatting

This plugin would be very silly to use in a template because
it simply returns the string unmodified.

It is more useful when selected as a formatting plugin for
modules or extensions that allow formatting selections and
do not include an option for "no formatting"

But if you insist...

    {exp:no_formatting}

        text you want to do absolutely nothing to

    {/exp:no_formatting}
