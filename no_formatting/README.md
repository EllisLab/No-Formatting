# No-Formatting

This plugin does absolutely nothing formatting wise. It's a dummy formatting option.

## Usage

### `{exp:no_formatting}`

This plugin would be very silly to use in a template because it simply returns the string unmodified.

It is more useful when selected as a formatting plugin for modules or extensions that allow formatting selections and do not include an option for "no formatting"

#### Example Usage

```
{exp:no_formatting}
	text you want to do absolutely nothing to
{/exp:no_formatting}
```
